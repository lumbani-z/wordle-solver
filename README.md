This is a project for CMPUT 366 that plays wordle.

Topics used by this program will be CSP, and policy learning

I intend to explore whether or not exploitation is better than exploration and if so, when is it best to exploit.

Exploitation will be defined as using the green letter constrains to cut the domain.
